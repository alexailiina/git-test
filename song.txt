When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song.

From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil,
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel.

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth.

Toss a coin to your Witcher!
Oh Valley of Plenty!
Oh Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh Valley of Plenty!

While the devil’s horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can’t be bleat.
