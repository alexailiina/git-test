When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song.

From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil,
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel.

Toss a coin to your Witcher!
Oh Valley of Plenty!
Oh Valley of Plenty!
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh Valley of Plenty!
